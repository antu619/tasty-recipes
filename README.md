# Tasty Recipes! üç≤

Recently, I explored `react-firebase-hooks` and CRUD Operation created a project named "Tasty Recipes" to practice my skills. This project was also part of my programming course on Firebase Authentication.

## Project Overview

"Tasty Recipes" features a delicious homepage with various sections such as "Our Food Categories", "Our Sea Foods", and a "Subscribe" section. The project leverages Firebase and `react-firebase-hooks` for authentication and data handling with CRUD Operation.

## Features

- **Authentication**: Users can register and log in using email/password, Google, or GitHub.
- **Protected Routes**: Users cannot access the dashboard page without being logged in.
- **Auto Redirect**: After logging in, users are redirected to the page they intended to visit.
- **Responsive Homepage**: The homepage includes food categories, a seafood section, and a subscribe section, all designed to be responsive.
- **Dynamic Homepage**: The homepage includes food categories, a seafood section, and a subscribe section.
- **Dashboard Panel**: Logged-in users have access to a dashboard where they can view their information on the User Info page.
- **User Information Management**: After logging in, user data is saved into the database. Users can view and edit their information.
- **CRUD Operations**: Logged-in users can add, edit, and delete seafood recipes.
